/*
let,var are used to declare variables
const for declaring constant
prefer not to use var bcoz of issue in block scope and functional scope
once declared const variable for one value we can't assign the same for another value as const value can't be changed
no change in js tho we use semicolon or not 
if we just declare a variable and leave it without allocating any value there then that will be assigned undefined value by default
